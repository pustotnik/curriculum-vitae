# My curriculum vitae

My personal markdown curriculum vitae with automatic generation of html, pdf
and docx (using pandoc and ConTeXt), and publishing on github pages.
Conversion from markdown to others is made with use of pandoc and ConTeXt (for pdf only).
And automation is made with docker and github actions.

Inspired by https://github.com/mszep/pandoc_resume,
https://github.com/chmduquesne/resume.chmd.fr,
https://github.com/vasylenko/serhii.vasylenko.info/tree/main/cv
and some other CV on the internet.
