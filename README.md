# My curriculum vitae

My personal markdown curriculum vitae with generation of html, pdf and docx,
and publishing on github pages. Everything is automated with github actions.

Inspired by https://github.com/mszep/pandoc_resume,
https://github.com/chmduquesne/resume.chmd.fr,
https://github.com/vasylenko/serhii.vasylenko.info/tree/main/cv
and some other CV on the internet.
